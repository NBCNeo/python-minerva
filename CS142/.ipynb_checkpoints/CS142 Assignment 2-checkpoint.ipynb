    "We can see this by looking at what $f$ is doing. It is simply duplicating every character in the string. This means that every $0$ will now become a $00$ and every $1$ will now become a $11$. The new language then does not allow to have the substring $101$ nor the substring $010$ because the string is composed of only sequences of $00$s and $11$s, thus those two substrings cannot appear in the string. Finally because the language $A$ had the condition that it needed to end with a $0$, then after applying $f$ the $0$ in the end became $00$, so the strings in $B$ have to end with $00$."
