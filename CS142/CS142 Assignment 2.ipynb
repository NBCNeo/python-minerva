The new language then does not allow to have the substring $101$ nor the substring $010$ because the string is composed of only sequences of $00$s and $11$s, thus those two substrings cannot appear in the string. Finally because the language $A$ had the condition that it needed to end with a $0$, then after applying $f$ the $0$ in the end became $00$, so the strings in $B$ have to end with $00$."

In each of these cases we add $D$ variables next to the $F$ variable, and after or before the decimal point (depending on the case) to allow for making the number as long as we want. This last part is possible by the rules in the eighth row (where we also have the rule $D \\rightarrow \\epsilon$ to stop adding numbers whenever we want).

We also add the rule $R_i → ε$ if $q_i$ is an accept state of the DFA. We make $R_0$ the start variable of the grammar, where $q_0$ is the start state of the machine.\n",

    "Because the right hand side of all the rules are $\\epsilon$ or of the form $aR_j$, where $a$ is a terminal and $R_j$ is a variable, then at any point in the derivation we will have a string of the form $xv$ where $x$ is made up of only terminal symbols and $v$ is made up of at most one variable. If there is at least one variable in the string, namely $R_i$, whatever string of terminals is to the left of that string, if given as input to the DFA, would take us to state $q_i$. This easily proven by induction on the length of the string $k\\geq1$ (remember the string has at least one variable):\n",

Here, the input to the left would be the empty string, thus the DFA given the empty string would indeed be at $q_0$\n",
    "- Hypothesis: if the string $xR_i$ has length $k=n$ then when the DFA receives $x$ as input, it will be at state $R_i$ after reading it entirely.\n",
    "- Inductive step: if the string $zR_j$ has length $k=n+1$ we want to prove that when DFA receives $z$, it goes to state $R_j$ after reading the input. If the last substitution before getting to $zR_j$ was given by the rule $R_i → aR_j$, then we use the hypothesis to know that when DFA receives $z[:-1]$ it ends at state $q_i$ and given that the rule $R_i → aR_j$ is only in the grammar when $δ(q_i,a) = q_j$, when the machine reads $a$ it will move from $q_i$ to $q_j$.\n",

    "Now, whenever a string generated by the grammar only has terminals, the previous step was having a string of the form $xR_i$ and we have proven that when the machine is given $x$ as input, it ends at state $q_i$, and the final step to make the string of only terminals is by using the rule $R_i → ε$, but we know that this rule only exists if $q_i$ is an accept state of the DFA, thus when the machine reads $x$, it will accept it.\n",
