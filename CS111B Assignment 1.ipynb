The reason for this is that, if two matrices are equivalent then we can get from one to the other with by a series of elementary row operations. This means that we could bring one matrix to the other (after some row operations) and doing the reducing to rref after they all have the same elements, should yield the same rref as the rref is unique for each matrix. Eliminating a row or a column for two matrices that are exactly the same yields the same matrix. \n",

The reason for this is that a row operation affects each element in the row independently from each other. Row operations affect each element in the row in the same way, this means that regardless of the other elements in a different column of the same row, after performing X operation to row Y, every element will be affected depending only on X and not on any other element in row Y."
